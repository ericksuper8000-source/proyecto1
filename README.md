# 🐍 Python Project — First Real-World Application

📅 *Started: January 14, 2026*
	*Current Date: January 20, 2026*

This repository contains my **first real Python project**, developed as part of my transition from learning exercises to building practical, real-world solutions.

Although the project is still in its early stages and evolving, the goal is **not** to create simple practice scripts, but to design, structure, and maintain a functional Python application following good development practices.

## 🎯 Project Purpose

This project aims to:

* Apply Python knowledge in a **real project context**
* Move beyond isolated exercises into structured development
* Practice writing clean, readable, and maintainable code
* Learn how to plan, build, and iterate on a Python project
* Document decisions, challenges, and improvements over time

---

## 🧠 Concepts & Skills Applied

Throughout the project, I work with:

* Python fundamentals
* Data structures (lists, dictionaries, tuples)
* Control flow (conditionals and loops)
* Functions and modular code
* Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
* Basic error handling
* Code organization and readability
* Version control with Git and GitHub

As the project grows, additional concepts and libraries may be added.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **Python 3**
* Git & GitHub
* Visual Studio Code (VS Code)

## 🚧 Project Status

🟡 **In progress**

This project is actively being developed. Features, structure, and documentation may change as I refine the idea and improve the implementation.

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ericksuper8000-source/ericksuper8000.git
```

Run the project (instructions will evolve as the project matures).

## 📚 Learning Philosophy

This repository reflects my belief that the best way to learn programming is by **building real things**, making mistakes, and improving through iteration.

Feedback, suggestions, and constructive criticism are always welcome.

Si quieres, en el siguiente paso puedo ayudarte a:

* Adaptarlo cuando ya sepas **qué hará el proyecto**
* Hacer una versión **más corta** para repos públicos
* Escribir un **README más técnico** (pensado para recruiters)
* Ajustarlo para que combine con tu perfil de LinkedIn

Solo dime 👍
