# ADR-0005 — Zero-Cost Cloud Strategy

**Status:** Accepted
**Date:** 2026-08-04
**Context:** Phase 0 — Planning (budget constraint)

---

## Decision

The project **must stay at $0 cost** for as long as possible (ideally forever). Every
cloud service, tool, and domain must be free-tier or free. Any expense requires explicit
justification, mentor discussion, and student approval **before** it happens.

For the VPS migration (Phase 9), the current first choice is a **free-tier provider** —
at the time of writing, **Oracle Cloud Free Tier** (Always Free) is the strongest
candidate because it offers permanent free VMs with usable resources, but the decision is
revisited at Phase 9 based on what is still available for free at that moment.

## Context & Problem

The student currently has no income. A realistic project must not silently accumulate
costs (a VPS, a domain, a monitoring service). This constraint shapes decisions across
the whole roadmap: cloud provider, CI minutes, registries, DNS, and certificates.

## Alternatives Considered

- **Paid VPS (e.g., a few USD/month)** — rejected: violates the $0 constraint.
- **Oracle Cloud Free Tier (chosen candidate)** — Always Free ARM/x86 VMs; best resource
  profile among free tiers. Downside: account verification friction and historical
  free-tier availability changes — must be re-verified at Phase 9.
- **Other free options (Google Cloud free tier, AWS Free Tier, free plans of Fly.io /
  Render / Railway)** — valid backups; each has limits (time-bounded or resource-thin) and
  is re-evaluated when we reach Phase 9.
- **Keep everything local (no VPS at all)** — always available as a fallback; the stages
  remain fully valid locally.

## Why This Option

The zero-cost principle is not a preference — it is a hard requirement given the student
has no income. Free tiers (especially Oracle Cloud Free Tier) give enough resources for
the exact scope of this project: a small Dockerized stack (Nginx + app + database) plus
CI/CD. If free tiers disappear, the project falls back to the local environment rather
than paying.

## Consequences

- Cloud, domain, DNS, CI, and registry choices are all constrained to free tiers.
- Oracle Cloud Free Tier is the default candidate, **not a locked decision** — it is
  re-verified in Phase 9 and recorded in the stage report.
- Any future expense needs an explicit "cost request" discussion with the mentor.

## If It Disappeared

Without this constraint, small costs would accumulate quietly. With it, the project
remains viable with no income — and the portfolio gains a realistic engineering
discipline: designing within hard constraints.
